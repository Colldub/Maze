10/29
    implemented "storeMaze" and "nextToExit"
        problems
            - did not build a next to exit that can know which cell is
                the goal just that there is one near.
            - didnt have time to change you still get a very similar output
    
10/30
    created a visited array to track where the program has gone in the maze

    implementad "addNeighboors" function

    fixed issues with delete functions not dealocating memory properly
    it runs and solves 1 and 2!!!

10/31
    unfortunatly becuase im not starting at S but instead (0,0) it works
    for 1 and 2 but not maze three.

    put a simple for loop in the main program to find the start.

11/1
    forgot i had tampered with maze 3 and was trying to solve an 
    unbeatable maze (facepalm)

Finished
